# Welcome!

Hello? SombrAbsol here!<br>No matter how you found my site, I welcome you!

Who am I? Well, I'm a writer for the PokÃ©mon Trash website. I'm also a French translator for some homebrews (TWiLight Menu++, Universal-Updaterâ€¦) as well as websites related to DS/DSi/3DS hacking.

This site (mine, right here, right now) allows me to put a few things I had fun translating. This is what I call video game "tools".

Feel free to take a look, it's always a pleasure! ðŸ˜„
